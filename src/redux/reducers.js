// reducers.js: This file contains reducer functions. 
// A reducer is a pure function that 
//  takes the current state and an action as arguments and returns a new state. 
// Reducers specify how the state should change in response to actions. 
// The root reducer combines multiple reducers 
//  into a single reducer that can be used to create the Redux store.
